The Wanderer's Lament

In Cyrodiil's embrace, where shadows dance and play,
I walked the cobbled streets at break of day.
The White-Gold Tower gleamed with ancient might,
While Kvatch burned crimson in the fading light.

Through Oblivion's gates, where Daedra roam,
I fought for Tamriel, far from my home.
With blade and spell, through fire and through pain,
I closed the portals, breaking Dagon's chain.

The Gray Fox whispered secrets in the night,
The Dark Brotherhood dealt death without a light.
I walked among the guilds, both high and low,
From Arcane University to the mines below.

In Skingrad's vineyard, wine like blood did flow,
While Bruma's mountains wore their crown of snow.
The Arena crowd would cheer my every kill,
As I became the Champion by force of will.

Martin Septim, priest who wore the crown,
Gave his life to save each city, every town.
He became the Dragon, fierce and true,
And Mehrunes Dagon back to Oblivion he threw.

Now silence reigns where once the battle raged,
A new era dawns, a blank and empty page.
The Hero of Kvatch, nameless, fades away,
Lost to legend, like the close of day.

By order of the Jauffre's sacred trust,
Remember those who fought, as all heroes must.
For when the gates open and darkness calls again,
New champions will rise from mortal men.

Stop right there, criminal scum! Nobody breaks the law on my watch!
...Or perhaps, dear wanderer, you've simply lost your way.

The sweetroll remains untouched upon the shelf,
Waiting for the thief to condemn himself.
