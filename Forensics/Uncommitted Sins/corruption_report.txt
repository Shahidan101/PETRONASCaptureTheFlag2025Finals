EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Database file 'vault.db' experienced catastrophic corruption during OBLIVION's
attack on 2147-01-20 at 11:03:22. Initial analysis suggests intentional
sabotage to prevent access to encrypted intelligence data.

CORRUPTION ASSESSMENT
---------------------
[WARNING]  Minor page-level anomalies detected in data pages
[WARNING]  Write-Ahead Log (WAL) file present but not checkpointed
[INFO]     Header integrity: INTACT (SQLite format 3)
[INFO]     Main tables: ACCESSIBLE but incomplete

The corruption is relatively minor - the database opens successfully, but
critical data appears to be missing from the main database file. Analysis
suggests data was being written when the system crashed, leaving uncommitted
transactions in the Write-Ahead Log.

AFFECTED TABLES
---------------
✓ access_logs       - INTACT (fully recoverable)
✓ system_info       - INTACT (fully recoverable)
✗ neural_pathways   - CORRUPTED (main data table, critical loss)
✗ deleted_commands  - FRAGMENTED (exists in WAL only)
✗ audit_trail       - FRAGMENTED (exists in WAL only)
✗ query_log         - PARTIAL (some entries in main DB, some in WAL)

TECHNICAL FINDINGS
------------------
1. DATABASE STRUCTURE
   - SQLite 3.39.4 format detected
   - Journal mode: WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
   - Page size: 4096 bytes
   - Encoding: UTF-8

2. ENCRYPTION DETECTED
   - Algorithm: AES-256-CTR (found in system_info metadata)
   - Implementation: Standard pycryptodome/OpenSSL compatible
   - Key derivation: Method UNKNOWN (see hypothesis below)
   
3. GEOGRAPHIC REFERENCES
   Unusual pattern detected: Multiple references to geographic coordinate
   systems found across different tables:
   
   - system_info.coordinate_system = "WGS84"
   - system_info.reference_point = "Prime Meridian at Royal Observatory"
   - system_info.precision_standard = "6 decimal places"
   
   HYPOTHESIS: Encryption key may be derived from a well-known geographic
   reference point. The Prime Meridian at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich
   is the internationally recognized zero-point for longitude.
   
   The note in neural_pathways mentions "zero point" and "reasonable precision".
   This likely refers to using the official WGS84 coordinates of the Airy
   Transit Circle, which defines the Prime Meridian, at standard 6-decimal
   precision.
   
   Research the exact location of this historic reference point to derive
   the encryption key.

4. QUERY FRAGMENTS DISCOVERED
   SQL fragments scattered across multiple tables suggest a reconstructable
   query pattern:
   
   Fragment sources:
   - query_log (accessible in main DB)
   - deleted_commands (WAL only)
   - audit_trail (WAL only)
   - system_notes (WAL only)
   
   Pattern suggests SELECT query with WHERE clause using numeric parameters.

5. WAL FILE ANALYSIS
   The vault.db-wal file contains uncommitted transactions from before the
   corruption event. This file was NOT integrated into the main database due
   to the abrupt shutdown.
   
   Standard SQLite recovery tools may extract this data:
   - Command: sqlite3 vault.db ".dump" (may fail on corrupted pages)
   - Alternative: Use specialized tools like 'undark' for SQLite recovery
   - Manual option: Parse WAL file structure (32-byte header + frames)
   
   WAL frames contain:
   - Page number references
   - Actual page data
   - Checksums (may be invalid due to corruption)

RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------
[1] DO NOT use sqlite3 directly - will fail on corrupted pages
[2] Extract data from WAL file using recovery tools or manual parsing
[3] Reconstruct SQL query fragments in sequence order
[4] Investigate coordinate-based key derivation hypothesis
[5] Cross-reference timestamps 2147-01-19 across all tables

INTELLIGENCE VALUE
------------------
If the neural_pathways table can be recovered and decrypted, it likely
contains Zero Code key fragments that are critical to the VanGuard mission.

The phrase "Coordinates hold the key to the past" was found in recovered
metadata - this is NOT a metaphor. It's a technical hint.

APPENDIX: USEFUL TOOLS
----------------------
- sqlite3: Built-in recovery limited but good for initial inspection
- undark: SQLite recovery tool (https://github.com/inflex/undark)
- DB Browser for SQLite: GUI for inspection
- Python sqlite3 module: For custom parsing scripts
- hexdump/xxd: For manual WAL file analysis

APPENDIX: KEY RESEARCH AREAS
-----------------------------
To solve this challenge, research the following:
- Prime Meridian: Official location and history
- Royal Observatory Greenwich: The Airy Transit Circle
- WGS84 coordinate system: Standard precision formats
- Geographic "zero points": How they're used in global positioning

The encryption key is derived from publicly available information about
a specific geographic landmark. Authorized personnel would know where to
look for this information.
